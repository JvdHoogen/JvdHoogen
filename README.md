- 👋 Hi, I’m @JvdHoogen
- 👀 I’m interested in Deep Learning, Time Series Classification and Research in general
- 🌱 I’m currently learning/developing 1D CNN models for classification and regression tasks using univariate and multivariate time series data, e.g., signal data in various domains such as Bearing Fault Detection and Seismological analysis.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on classification and regression tasks containing, but not limited to, large-scale signal data from sensors. 
- 📫 How to reach me, just contact me via my Github page.
